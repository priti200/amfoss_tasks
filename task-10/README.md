# Cs50
Cs50 was an informative tasks about many things. It gave a general view of everything related programming. So, It was very knowledgable task for me because I learnt a lot of new things.
I could not complete all the 4 weeks problems but I tried doing as much as possible. So, I completed all the problems from problem set-1 of Week-1 and one problem from problem set-2 of Week-2
I went through the videos but due to the time limit, I was not able to complete it
