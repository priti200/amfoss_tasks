# Bandit Game

At first, I was very new to this term SSH, so i went straight to my source of survival that is Google and started reading some articles on how to start with and then by leraning bit by bit i completed initial levels. I was familiar with the commands which was used in the earlier levels so it was easy to deal with but then as the levels increased the complexity also increased for which i had start the loop of googling until i finished it.

When I started playing with Bandit game, It became more interesting and fun to solve the levels. I wanted to do more levels but As I did not have more time. So, I completed uptolevel 10 and learnt the use of new commands.
