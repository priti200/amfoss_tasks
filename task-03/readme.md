# Hackerrank Problems

This was the most difficult task for me as I did not have a good coding background. So, I decided to do this task after finishing all the tasks which I was able to do. That too , I was able to complete only 4 hackerrank problems. I did in python because, In college I was taught python so i thought of using my time in a good manner and utilize whatever I was learning in college. Also, I followed W3school for most of the concepts i used while doing the tasks. 
I tried to complete as many questions as i could.

This task helped me a lot in logical thinking, problem solving etc. I learnt python for this task but eventually that helped me a lot in many tasks.
