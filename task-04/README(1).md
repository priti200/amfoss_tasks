## Task-04


## CineBot

This task was bit challenging as well as interesting for me as, I never tried this kind of project. I only heard about Bots
But never thought of making one. But with help of the good google articles , youtube video and also the given 
instructions which I followed ,I was able to complete it within 4 days. 

##Challenge faced

I faced some problem during installation of python3 and later on I resolved that problem and set up everything in vscode. Also Storing the movie data in a Csv file was a challenge
because I had no idea about how to store So, I took help from google and after reading some articles i was able to complete the task.
## Hosting

I hosted the CineBot using replit. It was also a great learning experience for me to host my project.Link is given below.
