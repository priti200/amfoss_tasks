 # Footfall counter

 This task was interesting even though i did not know anything about tinkerCAD and Arduino , I wanted to do this task. So, I started googling and got some what similar examples in which I made changes according to the task requirement. I did not get the output at first but eventually after some trial and errors , I got te required output. While doing the task , I learnt about different terms and its workings.
