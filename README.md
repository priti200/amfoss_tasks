##  My perspective about the tasks

Amfoss Praveshan tasks were authentically a blessing for me in the form of learning and exploring different fields of technology because i would not have been able to learn this much of new things without these tasks. I can proudly verbally express that i have utilised my first one and half months of college in a great way. I learnt an abundance of new terms related to technology. These challenges  push me out of my comfort zone and made me learn something new everyday to complete my tasks. Therefore , I completed 8 out of 10 tasks completely and the remaining 2 tasks partially from the main tasks.  Also ,I completed 3 out of 5 completely and 1 task partially from the  additional tasks. I have added the approach and overview of every tasks in a readme.md file inside the task folder.  Even though, it was something about learning and doing on your own, I realised every bit of it and learnt everything on my own with the avail of resources given in the cyber world.
