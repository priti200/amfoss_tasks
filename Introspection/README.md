# INTROSPECTION

### Why   must   we  choose  you ?
Before joining amrita university i got to know about the club called "amfoss" which  resides in amritapuri campus and since then i was determined to join amfoss club because i think amfoss would give me the exposure required to the outside world and its software advancement in open source development and i love  to contribute in open source community so i visually perceived amfoss  as a good opportunity to induce myself into the open source world and i believe i am a good dev who can try to solve or even "create" projects in the club . I would always maintain a "never give up attitude" which would boost everyones morale in the club which in turn would boost their confidence up. 


### What is your plan for the next 6 months ?
 My weakness right now would be in competitive coding so if i were to join amfoss club i would improve my skills in competitive coding and involve my self in competitive coding and i would like to improve my skills on  web development as i had found my passion in web development. I would be open to explore many fields which are present in the club.



### How would you contribute back to the club ?
After learning whatever i can from the club i would give all my knowledge and expertise back to the club so that the club could grow even more and i would help my fellow club members in any problems they  face in the club . I will also help my upcoming  juniors in achieving their goals as my seniors or mentors did for me. I would love to contribute in open source software development and add some great values to the club. 

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
Well in my opinion because of this selection process i got a taste of what it is to be an open source developer it opened my mind on what things open source devs could do. Overall everything is just awe-inspiring.
