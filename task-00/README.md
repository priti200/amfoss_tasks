## DUAL BOOTING 
### In my acer aspire 5

I had an old laptop in which i tried dual booting for thrice. But the system's working was not that good 
and due to battery problem every time i started booting it used to get off so i tried for few more time but then
i left it and waited for my new laptop to come. So, When my new laptop came , I installed the latest version of ubuntu 
and started dual booting.

I went through some videos on youtube to do this which eventually helped me in completing this task as well as in dual booting the system.
Now, Enjoying linux more than windows. It is fun to use and learn different commands.
