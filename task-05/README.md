# Find the Bug
## Interesting one 
 Basically I had to find the bug in the given server and client code and had to run this program to get the required output. I referred the documentation given in the amfoss github from where i got to know that i have to know about socket programming. Then I saw some videos and read some articles on socker programming to have a basic understanding of socket progrraming. There comes the debugging part ,  Actually it was easy because all we had to do was googling and fixing errors which i looped until my code became errorless. 
 
 After fixing all the errors when i started running my code, it was showing some directory errors for that i reffered a video and on following that i got the required output.
 
 With this task , I learnt how to find errors and fix it and also about the basics of socket programming  .
