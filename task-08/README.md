## Task-08

When I saw the tasks list for the first time, task-08 was the only task which I was confident about because
I learnt Html and Css so half of the thing I already knew But the major part that is Javascript I did not know.
So, for that I started learning Javascript but then I realized that I dont have enough time to learn everything
from scratch. And then I started learning how to add sounds to the buttons and for that I watched some videos, 
read some articles .Ultimately I learnt how to add sounds  and completed my task. Also It is one of my favourite
task because I love Web-development.
