## Flame Game

This task was kind of difficult for me because these terms were very new to me and I took more than 
a week to complete this flame game.
But it was all worth it when I saw my game running on the emulator.


## Challenges faced

I faced a lot of problems during installation of flutter,android studio,emulator setting, though it was not 
a big issue but it was my first time so I felt like it was bit difficult to cope up because I was facing so many
errors. Atlast I completed the setup part within two days and then comes the major part that is coding . As I never
heard about flutter, Flame engine and dart language. So all these terms were very new to me. I had no better 
option than youtube videos and googling to get started .But I wasted a lot of time watching the video , I thought
It would be helpful but it was not ,I found googling was the best option so I started reading articles related to 2D games
and started doing the task. I made a lot of mistakes but then i resolved all one by one. Navigation key part was also
a challenge as I took a lot of time.

## Overview

Atlast, after one week I was able to get my result which I was working for. This task taught me a lot as 
I never thought of game development but now I can say that yes I have some basic idea  about how to get started and 
proceed for game deveolpment. It was a great learning experience for me and enjoyed the process a lot.
This was one of my favourite task.
